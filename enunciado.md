 Computer Graphics Assignment 3 - 01/Dec/2025
Image Filters
The leading idea of this assignment is to provide the students with suited tools to master the fundamental
techniques behind image filters and edge detectors. For that purpose, students need to deeply study the
theoretical module #12 (T12), as well the cookbook chapter concerning image processing named “Image
Processing and Screen Space Techniques”.
1 Reference Code
Similar code examples are described in the cookbook chapter concerning image processing named
“Image Processing and Screen Space Techniques”.
2 Who does what?
The first digit (the rightmost) of the student number identifies the work. See next section to make sure
about your assignment.
